# Dominion Simulator

* In order to run the Simulator, you can run main.py
* If you want to see the output of the log, set LOGGING = True in Config.py
* If you want to run a bunch of games, change the for loop value in main.py, and I reccomend turning logging off.

Important folders:
* Players (and examples you can use/edit) are in the Players/ directory.
* Cards are located in the CardImpl directories. To make functional changes, edit the play_card() and/or duration_card() functions
